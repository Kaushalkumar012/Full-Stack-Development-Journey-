# 🗓️ Day 1: Understanding the Basics of the Internet
🌐 What is the Internet?
The internet is a massive network of interconnected devices that allows data exchange globally. It enables communication, information sharing, and access to services through various protocols like HTTP/HTTPS, FTP, etc.

🖥️ What are Servers and Clients?
Server:
A server is a powerful machine or software that provides resources, data, or services to other devices.
Examples: Web servers (host websites), database servers (store data), and file servers (store and share files).

Client:
A client is a device or application (like a browser or mobile app) that requests data or services from a server.
📍 Do Servers and Clients Have Different IP Addresses?
Yes!

IP Address (Internet Protocol Address): A unique identifier assigned to every device connected to the internet.
Servers have fixed (static) IP addresses to remain accessible.
Clients typically use dynamic IP addresses that can change over time.
